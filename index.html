            <p>
                [Refrain]<br>
                How can you miss someone you've never met?<br>
                'Cause I need you now but I don't know you yet<br>
                But can you find me soon because I'm in my head?<br>
                Yeah, I need you now but I don't know you yet<br>
                <br>
                [Chorus]<br>
                'Cause lately it's been hard<br>
                They're selling me for parts<br>
                And I don't wanna be modern art<br>
                But I only got half a heart<br>
                To give to you<br>
                <br>
                [Verse]<br>
                How can you miss someone you've never seen?<br>
                Oh, tell me are your eyes brown, blue, or green?<br>
                And do you like it with sugar and cream?<br>
                Or do you take it straight, oh, just like me?<br>
                <br>
                [Chorus]<br>
                Yeah, lately it's been hard<br>
                They're selling me for parts<br>
                And I don't wanna be modern art<br>
                But I only got half a heart<br>
                To give to you<br>
                <br>
                [Bridge]<br>
                And I hope it's enough<br>
                Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh<br>
                Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh<br>
                Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh<br>
                Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh<br>
                <br>
                [Refrain]<br>
                How can you miss someone you've never met?<br>

                But can you find me soon because I'm in my head?<br>
                Yeah, I need you now but I don't know you yet<br>
                <br>
                [Outro]<br>
                I need you now but I don't know you yet<br>
                I need you now but I don't know you yet<br>
                I need you now but I don't know you yet<br>
